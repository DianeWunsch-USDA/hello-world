# hello-world
This is my practice repository. There is nothing to see here.
I started this repository before the infamous government shutdown of 2018-2019. After being away for over a month, I have forgotten everything I learned in the beginning. 
It is very cold outside today. The wind is blowing. The sun is shining. It is not snowing.
